## 🎨 Demo vs Production

### This is a DEMO Version

**What's Mocked (Simulated):**

- 💾 **Database**: Data stored in memory (lost when server restarts)
- 📁 **File Storage**: Files saved locally, not in cloud
- 🔐 **Security**: Basic validation only

### For Production, You'll Need:
- Real email service (SendGrid, AWS SES)
- Real database (PostgreSQL, MongoDB)
- Cloud file storage (AWS S3)
- Enhanced security
- Admin dashboard
- Payment integration (if needed)

## 📊 View All Registrations

While the servers are running, you can view all submitted registrations:

Open in browser: **http://localhost:3001/api/registrations**

This shows all registration data submitted during the demo session.

**Q: Can I deploy this?**
A: Yes! See vercel.json and README.md for deployment instructions.

**Q: Is this mobile-friendly?**
A: Yes! Try resizing your browser or open on mobile.

**Q: Can I customize the design?**
